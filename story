Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest. When ever she went out she wore a red riding cloak. Everyone in the village called her little red riding hood.
One morning, little red riding hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother and it had been a while since they had seen each other.
