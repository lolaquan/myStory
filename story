Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest. When ever she went out she wore a red riding cloak. Everyone in the village called her little red riding hood.
One morning, little red riding hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother and it had been a while since they had seen each other.
"that's a good idea", her mother said. So they packed a nice basket for little red riding hood to take to her grandmother.
when the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye.
"Remember, go straight to grandma's house", her mother cautioned. "Don't dawdle along the way, and please don't talk to strangers. The woods are dangerous."
